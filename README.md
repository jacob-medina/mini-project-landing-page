## Description

[Click here to visit the live website.](https://jacob-medina.github.io/mini-project-landing-page/)

This project is a landing page mockup for a hypothetical company called Amp It Up, which provides equipment for bands doing gigs.

![Final look of the landing page](/assets/images/final-landing-page.png)

It provided ample practice in following a user story and acceptance criteria to create a product. I learned how to create a navigation bar and semantically add elements to a webpage.

## Usage

This project is a landing page mockup, so only a few key features are working.
A user may do the following:
- Click on the "Contact" button in the navigation menu to be brought down to the contact section
- Fill out the contact form with a name and email
- Click the "Send" button in the contact form
